Note
------------
This extension works only with in a Yii2 project, because Yii doesn't have a separate module (i.e. repo) for its caching mechanism. It's bundled in the core yiisoft/yii2 package. 

 
 Installation

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require daveferger/botman-yii2-cache "dev-master"
```

or add

```
"daveferger/botman-yii2-cache": "dev-master"
```
